# Cookiecutter-rye-ethernaut-template
Simple Cookiecutter template only for [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) using [`Ape`](https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape) using [`rye`](https://rye.astral.sh/).


## ðŸ’« Quickstart

Generate the project:

This project will use `rye` in an isolated enviroment. Make sure you have `curl` installed before running the following command.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/CyberPuzzlePros/Cookiecutter-custom-rye-ethernaut-template
```

The generator will automatically call `rye init & rye sync` at the end.


### With cruft

[cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) is a layer above Cookiecutter allowing you to update your project from the template after it has been generated.

```bash
cruft create https://github.com/CyberPuzzlePros/Cookiecutter-custom-rye-ethernaut-template
```
